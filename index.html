      <h3><bold>Other Skills</bold></h3>
      <p>
       To create publicity on some of the work I do in my freetime, I post to social media and to ensure that my work gets
       found by persons interested in it, I use keywords as some sort of identifiers. Recently, I found a website, 
       <span data-testid="keywordLink"><a href="http://keyword.dog/">keyword.dog</a></span>
        that could help me do this efficiently.
        <br><br>
       My tech journey is not one that I have been on alone, I've had learning partners such as <span data-testid="hngLink"><a href="http://hng.tech/learn">Hng</a></span>
       for internship and several other walk with me on this journey.
        <br><br>
       I write articles which I share on my blog and for this, I research papers and website to gather information.
       A web tool was recommended recently, <span data-testid="scrapeanywebLink"><a href="https://scrapeanyweb.site/">scrapeanyweb</a></span>. I can't say that I have used it however 
       it seems to be able to do a number of things.
